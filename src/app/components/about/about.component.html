    About this project

    <p>
      This project helped me learn about MEAN stack, particularly the back-end services (mongoDB, Express, NodeJS).
      <br><br>
      For the database, I hosted my own with Mongo Atlas, and Express server is hosted on Heroku.

      The tutorial I followed was made by CodingTheSmartWay.com and can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2_bcCZg8vQ">here</a>.
